This is experimental software.

**It aims to:**
- scaffold a reactive microservice network,
- be decentralised with self healing service discovery,
- have a interface description language (IDL) enabling many communication patterns,
- be secure and self contained with no 3rd party service dependencies.

**Targets for release 0.1.0:**
- AUTH server with management of keys, tokens, services, users and permissions
- Registration and login for services and frontends
- Admin frontend for administration of AUTH and permissions
- Implementation of IDL with pub/sub and req/res patterns
